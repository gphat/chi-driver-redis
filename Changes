Revision history for CHI-Driver-Redis

0.06 August 4, 2014
  * Set Redis encoding option to undef to disable encoding

  * Revert "Use hashes."
  * Change maintainer

0.05
  * Use hashes to store info rather than crazy sets and keys.
  * Indiscriminately turn off the UTF-8 flag on data coming out of
    Redis.pm so CHI can handle it.
  * Bump dependency versions.

0.04    March 17, 2010
  * Separate ping check from reconnection exceptions so that being disconnected
    doesn't become a permanent problem.  We now reconnect when Redis comes back.

0.03    March 17, 2010
  * PODed implementation details
  * Conditional tests

0.02    December 22nd, 2009
  * POD updates
  * Rename _redis attribute to redis
  * Lazily set redis attribute so that it is not populated until the first
    use.  This – plus some new error handling – prevent crazy explosions when
    Redis isn't available at instantiation time.
  * Add warning for when ->ping fails

0.01    Date/time
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
